# Disease-or-Condition-Analysis-Dashboard-in-Ms-Power-Bi-Using-NHSDW-datatable-london
content:
By creating a Power BI dashboard using NHSDW data, this project aims is to Analyze Specific diseases or condition prevelent in london,such as Asthama and Copd etc.Visualize the prevalence rates,prevalence by Asthama and Copd ,total sales,top 5 pcn by sales and calculate prevalence by pcn and forecasting next 3 month sales in linear regression using chart and Area and point map

STEPS FOLLOWED:-
1-Data Extraction: The data is extracted and stored into the pg admin
2-Data Transformation & Cleaning: The data is transformed into Power BI by pgadmin server and cleaned the data using Power Query Editor. For data cleaning I remove null values, duplicates, replace some words, and add columns.
3-Data Loading: After proper cleaning the data is load into Power BI.
4-Data Modeling : After loading the data the next step is data modeling ,data modeling refers to the process of establishing relationships between tables, there are 3 type of relationship i.e one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many
5-Data Visualization: After loading of the data perform certain visuals using different charts, graphs, slicer and makes a dashboard.
6-Data Analysis: After creating dashboard we perform data analysis and uncover certain insights from the same.

MY key Learning from this project are:
AS a beginner i learned how to connect a database using pgAdmin and about ETL i.e , extract,transform and load data .Along with how to analyze table and relation .How to clean the data in power query window.
Some the DAX function like SUM,CALCULATE,ALL,DATESINEPERIOD,etc .in short learnt how to create measures.
interrelation of table i.e, here i learnt about Star Schema.
and finally,how to create a dashboard according to specific need and furthemore analyzing the graphs and trends and forecasting  accordingly.
